# IT Logger

A ReactJS + Redux project built from the 'React Front To Back 2019' Udemy course by Brad Traversy.
IT Logger is a full stack MERN application created while following the 'React Front To Back 2019' Udemy course by Brad Traversy. The application simulates a log for a system technician, showing any work done to a system item, who performed the log, and when it was performed. The user can add/edit/search/delete logs and add/delete system technicians. Instead of using the Context API IT Logger uses Redux for managing application state. IT Logger was initially created using the JSON Server package to use as a fake REST API but now uses MongoDB as a database system and ExpressJS to communicate with the backend.
